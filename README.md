Student Performance Evaluation and Prediction using Machine Learning
This repository contains the code for a machine learning model that can be used to predict the academic performance of students. The model is trained on a dataset of past grades, attendance, test scores, and demographic information.

Getting Started
To get started, you will need to install the following dependencies:

Python 3

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

In this project,


1.collect the data from our depatment of our class.The datset contains marks of students semester-wise and doesn't contain null values and duplicate values.


2.Checked the correlation of complete dataset


3.Applied Different Classification models like Fisher's LDA and Naives Bayes Classifier and checked the Accuracy of the Models.


4. Predicted every student's Performance in the current year based on the previous semester performance using Multiple Linear Regression.


As a result,We identify Fisher's LDA provided most accurate result and classified student's into 4 categories like Gate,Higher Studies,Not Eligible,Programmer.
